# vdo-bashcomp
this repo holds the data for vdo's bash completion that I am writing

This repo will be helpful in finding how I went from nothing in the bash completion to having a bashcompltion source. The reason that I want it to be here, is so that people who want to learn a thing or two, can go with it.


I am a newbie and therefore you may find mistakes or things that I could have done better, I would appreciate any feedback, good or bad or even ugly. :)

# Update March 10, 2019

I am learning about Regular Expressions so that I can write a function which can then parse the options that `vdo <command> --help` would provide.

The source that I am using to read about the regular expressions is : https://mywiki.wooledge.org/RegularExpression

Who knew string and pattern matching can be a pain in the ass (in the beginning) 

Also, I learnt another thing, it is only difficult in the beginning. If you keep doing it it will keep on getting easy. :)


--- Update 9 March 2019

. I should modify the function _parse_usage to work just for vdo.
such as _parse_usage_vdo
