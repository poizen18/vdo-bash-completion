# vdo-bashcomp
this repo holds the data for vdo's bash completion that I am writing

This repo will be helpful in finding how I went from nothing in the bash completion to having a bashcompltion source. The reason that I want it to be here, is so that people who want to learn a thing or two, can go with it.


I am a newbie and therefore you may find mistakes or things that I could have done better, I would appreciate any feedback, good or bad or even ugly. :)


--- Update 9 March 2019

. I should modify the function _parse_usage to work just for vdo.
such as _parse_usage_vdo
